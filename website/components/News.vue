      until Saturday, March 13 in CA, MI, NYC, PA, NJ, OH, OR, and WA. On
      Saturday, Rite Aid appointments should re-open to other eligible groups
      again. I'm keeping the appointments shown to help for any educators
      looking for vaccines, but in the meantime, please ignore if you are not
      eligible. Any feedback is welcome:

      or <a href="https://twitter.com/nickblah">@nickblah</a>. And if you're a
      coder and have interest in helping out on
      <a href="https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-finder/issues">GitHub</a>,
      that would be dandy (although the code's still messy)!
