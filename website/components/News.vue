      <strong>03/10/2021:</strong> <strong>Walgreens</strong> appointment
      availability should hopefully be much more reliable now. ðŸ˜Œ I've had to
      workaround issues with how the Walgreens website works, but now
      appointments should only show up on Vaccine Spotter if you can book both a
      first and second appointment. Sorry, I know this has been a source of
      frustration for many! Any feedback is welcome:

      coder and have interest in helping out on
      <a href="https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-finder/issues">GitHub</a>,
      that would be dandy (although the code's still messy)!
